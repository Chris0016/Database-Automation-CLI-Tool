# Database Automation Tool

Essentially this program is a tool to insert random data into tables. The kind of data can be customized in a variety of ways and order. This is is all done as a command that is carried out. The project was built using Picocli.

## So why use this tool?

Most often, the data across different tables is the same such as name, email, phone numbers, or money and so on. This program takes the approach treating those column values as reusable entities that can be shared and reused across different tables. What this implies is that we can build a variety of tables with different values using discrete units. Furthermore, you won't need to download massive csv files for every table.
